# Workflow & Task Management

## âœ… Task Completion

- **Mark completed tasks in `*.tasks.instructions.md` immediately after finishing**
- **Add discovered tasks under "Discovered During Work" section**
- **Use direct workspace operations (VS Code search, terminal, file explorer) over external tools**
- **Provide "Run in Terminal" buttons for all command suggestions**
- **Proceed with file operations if accessible; only notify user if access denied** for the user to execute the command directly through the AI agent.
- The AI should display the command and a button labeled "Run in Terminal" (or similar).
- If the user clicks the button, the AI should execute the command and display the output.
- If the user prefers, they can copy and run the command manually.
- This ensures a smooth workflow and gives the user full control over command execution.
